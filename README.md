# Cheetah
A 16-bit unsigned integer that can be simultaneously used to store the same value in Hexadecimal and Decimal number bases.

# What is Cheetah?

Cheetah is a proof-of-concept project made to test feasibility of storing integers in Hexadecimal format, while letting the user interact with them in the normal manner.

# How to use Cheetah?
```sh
//STEP 1:
//Move the "bitfield.h" and "bitfield.cpp" files to your project directory

//STEP 2:
//Add the following line to your C++ code
#include"bitfield.h"

//STEP 3:
//Create an object of type "Bitfield" to use cheetah integers, for example:
Bitfield my_integer = 5;
```
Cheetah can be used just like ant 16-bit unsigned integer.
